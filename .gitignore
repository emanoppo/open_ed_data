# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# The coveralls gem depends on the simple_cov gem to test your code coverage.
# When your tests are run it will provide a report of your code coverage and
# put it into a /coverage directory. We want to ignore this to reduce noise in
# our git commits.
